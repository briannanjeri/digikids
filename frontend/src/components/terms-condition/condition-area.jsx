              Our terms and conditions govern the enrollment, tuition, cancellation, transfer, and refund policies for
              our courses at digikids. These policies ensure fairness and clarity in our interactions with students and
              their families. We reserve the right to cancel a class or enrollment for certain reasons, but we also
              guarantee a full refund in such cases.

              fees or using our materials for commercial purposes. By enrolling in our courses, students and their
              families agree to these terms and conditions.

              Digikids reserves the right to cancel a class. Unless such class is cancelled due to conditions beyond our

              class starts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fees of a paid class can be transferred to another program only if the booked class has been cancelled
              by the student 1 week in advance. The transferred payment must be used by the same registered student.
